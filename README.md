add-to-page2rss
===============

Chrome extension which creates a RSS feed for any page using page2rss.com. This extensions is in no way affiliated to [page2rss.com](http://page2rss.com) but a separate extension.

I created this extension due to a missing feature in the official [page2rss](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page2rss/lhikkakcmddjomilpjgdepfgmakpekeh?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) extension. Instead of a browser action it triggers a page action which can only be used whenever a page does not have any valid RSS feed. However, there are pages which might have a valid RSS feed but which is not the one you are looking for. In contast, my extension is triggered on any page using a browser action.
